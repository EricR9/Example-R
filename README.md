# Example-R

This is example code that I have developed over several years.  It includes multiple statistical techniques that can be applied to 
a broad spectrum of data science challenges.

Boxplot DensityPlot.R - Generates descriptive statistical ouputs of histogram with normal lines and boxplot overlaid.  Density
plots are also created with overlaid median values of the samples.

Error Check Cntl Chart.R - Control chart where sample size is one (n=1).  Uses a moving range in order to compute variability.

Line Graph with Error Bars.R - Standard descriptive chart which plots the mean value of a categorical variable as well as the
standard error of the mean.
